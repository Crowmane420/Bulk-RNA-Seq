# To replicate the following workflow Linux is a requirement. All the following actions were executed in Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS.

# In this experiment we are working with a set of 12 samples which is spread across two tissue types (Root and Shoot), collected at time points 4, 8, and 16. 
# The Samples are further divided based on their condition (Control and Treatment) with each sample being in treplicates.
# View the metadata file for the detailed information.

# The first step with Raw reads is to check for their quality, we will be focusing on Phread score, duplication levels and adapter contamination for the most part.
# Aside from the abovementioned parameters we can also confirm the read length of our reads as well as GC percentage by doing QC.

# The common QC-tool for short reads are FastQC.
# We provide .fastq files as input for FastQC and it will generate a .html QC report for our .fastq file.
# FastQC can be obtained by either downading the java tool from https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/ which requires a suitable Java Runtime Environment (https://adoptium.net/).
